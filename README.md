# Variational-Autoencoder-VAE-on-MNIST-using-PyTorch

This repository contains an implementation of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) using PyTorch on the MNIST dataset. The goal is to learn a compressed latent representation of digit images and reconstruct them while understanding the generative capabilities of VAEs.

## What is a VAE?
A Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is a type of generative model that learns not just to compress and reconstruct data, but also to generate new data samples by learning a latent distribution. It builds on top of the traditional autoencoder by incorporating principles from Bayesian inference.
